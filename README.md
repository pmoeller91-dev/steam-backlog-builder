# Steam Backlog Builder

This is a project created as a portfolio project for the back-end developer
course on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev)

Steam user? Not sure what to play? Prices on newer games too high right now?
Have a Steam library overflowing with games from cheap and free bundles from
ages past? Then **Steam Backlog Builder** is for you!

perfect next games to play. Save money, clear out those old unplayed games, and
experiences gems you may have overlooked.
